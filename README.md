# RidleyTools
Idaho BLM GIS data management tools for Field Office GIS Specialists
The collected scripts and ArcGIS toolbox are intended to be stored side by side, due to dependencies between each of the main scripts and AddMsg.py/FixLinks.py
\nThe RidleyTools ArcGIS toolbox script tools were built with relative paths, which would require repathing should the toolbox be moved relative to the python scripts they reference.
